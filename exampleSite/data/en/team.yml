      Having forged a successful career at Citigroup, and built his own consulting practice, Rick Bilby brings a unique blend of financial know-how and project management to the table, which puts him in prime position to guide burgeoning SMEs. In 1993, Rick started his career as a Project Manager in Risk Architecture at Citigroup.  This sent him on a global path, advancing through Risk Management roles at Citi in Düsseldorf and Hong Kong, improving infrastructure for many thousands of users.

      Today, Rick channels his energy into smaller, but equally rewarding, projects. Having lived in several countries, he is now a skilled communicator in French and German. Since 2020, Rick has also held a Director role at an AI/tech start-up, project-managing a new e-commerce website selling pro-quality film-making equipment.

      His thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, having completed AGILE Project Management training, a BSc in Physics at Imperial College London, and an Executive MBA at Salford University Business School.

      Some of Rick’s biggest improvements include streamlining workflows by 50% for 20,000 client organisation members – but he is just as talented outside of work. A musician, sportsman and entrepreneur, Rick has been managing projects all his life, and relishes the opportunity to work with new people.
