  title: 'Critical Wireless Design Aspects and RF Design Process '
  content: "Our professional design takes capacity as well as coverage into account.
    Covering the areas where signal is needed is relatively easy to do and definitely
    part of the equation. \n\nHowever, coverage just is not enough. Today, you need
    context and that means capacity. An optimally designed wireless network takes
    the different kinds and amount of devices being used as well as the applications
    being run on those devices into account An experienced hotel wireless solution
    does not just add more access points and hope for the best. \n\nWord to the wise,
    just throwing up more access points can actually create more issues and ends up
    putting a hole on your pockets.\n\nThis is why we have pointed out below the most
    critical and important aspects and methodologies we are following.  "
